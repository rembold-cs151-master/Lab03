# Lab 4

You only need to edit the `Lab04.py` file for today's lab! Instructions are on the main webpage. Make sure when you upload your final version back to here, that you leave it with the same name! You want it to override the old, mostly empty version!

There are some auto-tests included with this lab, so you'll be able to look for the green checkbox to see if everything went well.
